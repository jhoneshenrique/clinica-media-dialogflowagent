# Health Center Dialogflow Agent
>This agent was developed on an online Dialogflow Course at Universidade Global. During the training, we could practice some useful skills like the creation of 
>intents,followup intents, entities, context, fulfillments, integration, and so on. Inicially, that project didn't access any database. However, I boosted it up
>and added a couple of new intents that worked with firestore. For now, I didn't make any validation on te recording on the database, but the code is useful to 
>understand how the integration between Dialogflow and Firebase works.
